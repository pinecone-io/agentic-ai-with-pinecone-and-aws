# Welcome to ChatterPine 2000

A chat-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that combines Pinecone vector search with web search to provide intelligent responses. This app uses Amazon Bedrock for AI reasoning and can access both your private knowledge base and real-time web information.

## What it does

- **Smart Search**: Automatically chooses between Pinecone vector search (for your private data) and web search (for general knowledge)
- **AI-Powered**: Uses Amazon Bedrock's Claude model for intelligent reasoning and response generation
- **Dual Knowledge Sources**: Combines information from your Pinecone index with current web data
- **Conversational**: Maintains context throughout your chat session

## How to use

Simply type your questions in the chat interface. The app will intelligently determine whether to search your private knowledge base or the web, then provide comprehensive answers based on the retrieved information.
